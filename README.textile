p. This program represents a proof of concept for red2xml project. It consist of database interface
for Redis, XML transformer for saving/loading xml parts to database and DOM elements.

h1. INSTALLATION

p. To use this project correctly, you have to download and start Redis instance. Redis doesn't have official
binaries for Windows, but i have found pretty stable and verified binaries here:
"https://github.com/dmajkic/redis/downloads":url
I have tested newest version 2.4.2
For nokogiri it is needed to install gem nokogiri on windows, it should be enough to just:
gem install nokogiri
But it does not work yet correctly, for detailed info:
