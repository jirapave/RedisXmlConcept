h1. ABOUT

p. This program represents a proof of concept for RedXML project. It consist of database interface
for Redis, XML transformer for saving/loading xml parts to database and DOM elements.

h1. INSTALLATION

p. To use this project correctly, it is needed to download and start Redis instance. Redis doesn't have official
binaries for Windows, but we have found pretty stable and verified binaries here:
"https://github.com/dmajkic/redis/downloads":url
We have tested newest version 2.4.2, otherwise when used on UNIX distributions, version from official site can be used.
For nokogiri it is needed to install gem nokogiri on windows, it should be enough to just:
gem install nokogiri
But it does not work yet correctly, for detailed info:

All callings are based on official documentation of Redis, looks really promising. The list of commands can
