h1. ABOUT

p. RedXml library is a project focusing on creating a basis for new XML native database. It is based on "Redis":http://redis.io/
key-value database as it's underlying storage. RedXml uses own mapping of XML files into Redis and creates new
abstraction layer to easily work with those documents. Currently proprietary API is supported (XML:DB API in the
future) to work with environments, collections and documents. XPath/XQuery languages are beying implemented as a
main way to query stored XML files.

*Important:* Project is still under development

h1. INSTALLATION

p. To use this project correctly, it is needed to download and start Redis database instance. It is strongly
recommended to use official redis binaries:
"Redis download page":http://redis.io/download
Redis doesn't have official binaries for Windows, but we have found pretty stable and verified binaries here:
"redis windows binaries":https://github.com/dmajkic/redis/downloads
Use them only if speed is not an issue or to just test the library, you should avoid them in real-life application.
(Storing and retrieve times can be 20x times slower).
Another prerequisite is Nokogiri library, you can do that by using "gem install nokogiri" command, for detailed info:
"Nokogiri installation guide":http://nokogiri.org/tutorials/installing_nokogiri.html

h1. PROPOSED FUNCIONALITY

h2. Short-term

* Completion of proprietary API for managing XML documents
* Support for optimistic locking on document-level
* Implementation of XPath/XQuery language with XQuery Update Facility (subset - most useful queries)

h2. Mid-term

* Implementation of XML:DB API

h2. Long-term

* Transactions
* Indexing

h1. USED LIBRARIES

p. Project uses some libraries, which are part of this library or you have to install them by hand (see installation)
* "Redis-rb":https://github.com/ezmobius/redis-rb - Client for Redis database
* "Nokogiri":http://nokogiri.org/ - Library for working with XML files
